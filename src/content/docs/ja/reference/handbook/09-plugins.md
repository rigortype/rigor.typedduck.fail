This is the shortest chapter. Plugins exist for one reason:
some methods' types depend on the **shape of their arguments
at runtime** in ways that no RBS sig can express.

## When you reach for a plugin

The classic case is a domain-specific evaluator:

```ruby
Lisp.eval([:+, 1, 2])           # Integer at runtime
Lisp.eval([:<, 1, 2])           # bool at runtime
Lisp.eval([:if, true, "a", 0])  # String | Integer at runtime
```

The return type depends on the literal first symbol of the
argument array. RBS can only say `untyped` here; Rigor's
inference can do nothing about it; an `RBS::Extended`
directive cannot vary by argument shape. **A plugin can.**

Other shapes that fit the plugin niche:

- **Units-of-measure DSLs** — `100.kilometers / 2.hours`
  produces a `Speed`, but Ruby's runtime sees a method on
  Integer that returns a user class.
- **Route helpers** — `users_path` returns a String, but
  whether the helper exists at all depends on a YAML file
  the analyzer has to read.
- **State machines** — `transition_to(:foo)` is fine if
  `:foo` is in a `state_machine do ... end` block declared
  somewhere; otherwise it is a typo.
- **Custom validators** — `validate(:email, value)` should
  catch a literal that does not match the named pattern at
  lint time.

Each of these has a worked example in
[`examples/`](https://github.com/rigortype/rigor/blob/main/examples/README.md). The
[`examples/README.md`](https://github.com/rigortype/rigor/blob/main/examples/README.md) page
compares the six plugins on architectural axes (config
schema, file I/O, cache producers, engine-collaboration via
`Scope#type_of`, …) and recommends a reading order.

## What a plugin can do today

The v0.1.0 plugin contract — pinned at
[`docs/internal-spec/plugin.md`](../../internal-spec/plugin/)
and laid out across a handful of slice specs in the same
directory — gives a plugin three primary surfaces:

1. **`#diagnostics_for_file(path:, scope:, root:)`** — the
   per-file emission hook. Walk the parsed AST, return an
   array of `Rigor::Analysis::Diagnostic` rows. The runner
   stamps each with `source_family: "plugin.<your-id>"`. All
   six worked examples use this hook.
2. **`Plugin::IoBoundary#read_file`** — sandboxed file reads
   under the active `TrustPolicy`. Use this when the plugin
   needs to read project files (route tables, schemas,
   locale files). `examples/rigor-routes` is the reference
   example.
3. **`Plugin::Base.producer` + `#cache_for`** — plugin-side
   cache producers. Use these for parses / lookups expensive
   enough to want cross-run caching. Auto-invalidates on
   the digest of every file the IoBoundary read while
   building the result.

## What a plugin cannot do today (intentionally)

Plugins can emit diagnostics, but they cannot **replace the
analyzer's inferred return type for a call site**. The
`FlowContribution`-based plugin contribution surface that
would let plugins emit return-type bundles is queued for a
later v0.1.x slice. Until then, plugins surface their
inferred types as `:info` diagnostics — useful as a trace,
not a tightening.

That is exactly the constraint the worked examples document
at the top of their `lib/rigor/plugin/<id>.rb` files: the
plugin sees the right type, the user sees the right
diagnostic, but the analyzer's internal call-site inference
is unchanged. When the v0.1.x return-type contribution slice
ships, the same plugin code will move from emitting
diagnostics to producing FlowContribution bundles, and the
prose around each example's "Future direction" section
becomes the implementation.

## Should you write one?

Probably not — most projects benefit from RBS and
`RBS::Extended` long before they hit the plugin niche.
Reach for a plugin only when:

- A domain DSL's typing depends on argument shape, file
  contents, or cross-method declarations.
- You are willing to maintain the plugin gem alongside your
  application.
- The team can read the plugin's source — it is not a black
  box anyone can ignore.

If those are true, [`examples/README.md`](https://github.com/rigortype/rigor/blob/main/examples/README.md)
is your starting point. The
[`rigor-deprecations`](../../examples/rigor-deprecations/)
example is under 80 lines and is the recommended template
for "I want to author my first plugin."

## What's next

You have reached the end of the handbook. From here:

- Cover-to-cover re-reading is rarely useful — most readers
  return to specific chapters as questions arise.
- The [Handbook index](../) has the cross-references
  to deeper material in
  [`docs/type-specification/`](../../type-specification/),
  [`docs/internal-spec/`](../../internal-spec/), and
  [`docs/adr/`](../adr/).
- The [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/rigortype/rigor/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) is the per-release
  truth for what shipped when.

Welcome to the small, growing community of static-Ruby
believers.
