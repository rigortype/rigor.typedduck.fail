Rigor runs on Ruby 4.0 (see
[Appendix — Installing Rigor](../appendix-installation/)). In CI that
has one consequence worth stating up front; the rest of this page
follows from it.

## Run Rigor in its own job

Run Rigor in a **separate CI job** from your test suite — better
still, a separate workflow file. The reason is concrete:
`ruby/setup-ruby` sets the *job's* active Ruby. A test job
provisions the Ruby your project runs (often a 3.x version, or a
matrix of several); Rigor needs Ruby 4.0. The two cannot share a job
without the second `setup-ruby` call clobbering the first.

A separate job gives Rigor a clean runner where provisioning Ruby
4.0 conflicts with nothing. A separate workflow file additionally
gets its own triggers, concurrency group, and status badge — and
keeps the analyser out of the test workflow, which is good practice
regardless.

## A minimal GitHub Actions workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/rigor.yml
name: rigor
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  rigor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: "4.0"
      - run: gem install rigortype
      - run: rigor check
```

That is the whole thing: check out the project, provision Ruby 4.0,
install Rigor, run it.

## Pinning Rigor's version

The workflow above installs whatever `rigortype` is current at run
time. To pin a version — and keep CI reproducible — choose one of:

### A CI-only `Gemfile` (recommended)

Commit a two-line `.github/rigor/Gemfile`:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem "rigortype", "~> 0.1"
```

plus its `Gemfile.lock`, and point the Rigor job at it through
`BUNDLE_GEMFILE`:

```yaml
jobs:
  rigor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      BUNDLE_GEMFILE: .github/rigor/Gemfile
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: "4.0"
          bundler-cache: true
      - run: bundle exec rigor check
```

This `Gemfile` is read only by the Rigor job — it never enters your
application's dependency resolution, and the committed lockfile
pins Rigor and its dependencies for a reproducible run. Because it
is an ordinary Bundler `Gemfile`, Dependabot can keep it current:
add a `bundler` entry scoped to its directory in
`.github/dependabot.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: bundler
    directory: /.github/rigor
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
```

### A pinned `gem install`

`gem install rigortype -v "0.1.9"` in the workflow. Simpler, with no
extra files — but Dependabot does not see a version inside a `run:`
step, so updates to the pin are manual.

## Container image

A standalone image is published to GHCR with Ruby 4.0 and Rigor
baked in. It suits CI runners with no Ruby toolchain — mount the
project on `/src`:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" ghcr.io/rigortype/rigor check
```

`rigor` is the image entrypoint, so subcommands and flags follow the
image name. Pin a version with an explicit tag —
`ghcr.io/rigortype/rigor:0.1.9`.

## Nix

For CI that already runs Nix, the flake exposes Rigor as a package
with Ruby 4.0 in its closure — a fully hermetic run with nothing
else on the runner:

```sh
nix run github:rigortype/rigor#rigor -- check
```
